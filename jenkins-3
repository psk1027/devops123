         IN INTERVIEWS THEY WILL ASK LIKE HOW MANY WAYS TO SETUP OR     
		
		INSTALL JENKINS

         IN WINDOWS OR  JENKINS PAGE AND INSTALL BEFORE INSTALL JAVA
 MOST OF THE ORG NOT USED MOSTLY IN WINDOWS

        LINUX FLAVOUR
      
          3  USING WAR FILE OR JENKINS.JAR DIRECTLY DOWNLOAD
         
          4     JAVA -JAR JENKINS.WAR WITH JAROR WAR FILE
            GO WITH INSTALL THROUGH DOCKER  FOR JENKINS
            
             TOMCAT INSTALL  JENKINS.ZIP FILE PLACE INTO TOMCAT   APP SERVER
               

                                       

                   COMMANDS
               
                       SYSTEMCTL IS CMD WHETHER THE  SERVICE IS UP OR NOT

                   			SYSTEMCTL STATUS JENKINS.SERVICE
                       
                                                       SYSTEMCTL  ENABLE   
                     PLUGINS SHOULD BE RESTARTED   AUTOMATICALLY COMEUP
COPY THE JENKINS PASSWORD 


CAT COPY





1  DOCKER INSTALL AFTER INSIDE DOCKER    
     INSTALL JENKINS

 2.    GET.DOCKER.COM  

CMDS 
      
         TO CHECK SYSTEMCTL STATUS , ENABLE
IN DOCKERHUB 


           INSTALL JENKINS
COPY AND RUN 

   DOCKER CONTAINER RUN -ITD -P 8081:8080 JENKINS/JENKINS


TO VERIFY 
   
           DOCKER CONTAINER LS
\
TO GO INSIDE JENKINS CONTAINER 
     
         WE USE CMD AS DOCKER CONTAINER EXEC -IT CONTAINR ID /BIN/BASH SMALL LETTERS


BETTER ALWAYS INSTALL DOCKER 
ANSIBLE WITHIN YOUR DOCKER CONTAINER ITSELF

MAVEN OR GRADLE INDUSTRY IN CONTAINER

 CMD DOCKER STATS

  
           Let me check users 
Post jenkins installation
Which are all the users in my system

Sudo  cat   /etc/passwd
 Users are there in system jenkins it  is home dir

Post installation of jenkins , you are trying to check which all are the users in linux
 Cat etc/passwd

Jenkins user by default created not forgot this
The default home dir of j /var/lib/jenkins.  Login with bash shell

Able to install normal user or sudo user ubuntu install pkgs

Now if you want to be jenkins user 
The root and sudo su -jenkins
Jenkins user can install pkg asked passwd
You canâ€™t do because jenkins is a normal user
